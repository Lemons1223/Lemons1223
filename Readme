# R Data Analysis Project

This R script performs various data analyses on sales, products, and vendor data using SQL queries through the `sqldf` package. Here's an overview of the script and its functionalities:

## Libraries Used

```r
library(data.table)
library(sqldf)
```

## Data Import

The script imports several CSV files using `fread()` from the `data.table` package:

- tSales.csv
- tProducts.csv
- BibitorPriceList.csv
- tStores.csv
- tPurchases.csv
- tVendors.csv
- tInvoices.csv

## Data Preprocessing

Date columns are converted to character type for compatibility with `sqldf`:

```r
invoices$InvoiceDate <- as.character(invoices$InvoiceDate)
invoices$PODate <- as.character(invoices$PODate)
invoices$PayDate <- as.character(invoices$PayDate)
purchases$ReceivingDate <- as.character(purchases$ReceivingDate)
sales$SalesDate <- as.character(sales$SalesDate)
```

## SQL Queries

The script includes several SQL queries using `sqldf()`:

1. Calculate total revenue for Seagrams 7 Crown products.
2. Compute gross profit for Ole Smoky Pumpkin Pie in stores 40-49.
3. Summarize purchase and invoice amounts by vendor.
4. Calculate gross profit for wine products.
5. Identify the top-selling product by bottles sold.

## Usage

To run this script:

1. Ensure all required CSV files are in the working directory.
2. Install and load the `data.table` and `sqldf` packages.
3. Run the script in an R environment.

## Note

- Modify file paths if the CSV files are not in the working directory.
- Ensure proper data types and formats in the CSV files for accurate results.
